# Customer-Churn-Records
Project Description:

The objective of this machine learning project is to develop a classification algorithm to predict customer churn in a bank. Customer churn refers to the decision of a customer to leave the bank, which is a critical concern for financial institutions. By accurately identifying customers who are likely to churn, the bank can implement targeted retention strategies and loyalty programs to reduce customer attrition.

The dataset provided contains various attributes related to bank customers, including their credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products purchased, credit card ownership, activity status, estimated salary, and more. These attributes are potential indicators of customer churn and will be utilized in the classification algorithm.

The project will involve exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between the features and customer churn. Feature engineering techniques may be applied to enhance the predictive power of the algorithm. Various classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines, will be trained and evaluated to determine the best model for predicting customer churn.

The performance of the classification algorithm will be assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model will be fine-tuned to optimize its performance, and cross-validation techniques will be employed to ensure robustness.

The successful completion of this project will enable the bank to proactively identify customers at risk of churning, allowing them to implement targeted retention strategies and enhance customer loyalty. This machine learning solution has the potential to significantly impact the bank's customer retention efforts, thereby contributing to its long-term success and profitability.
